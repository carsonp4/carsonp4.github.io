I have always been a huge fan of film awards season and wanted to look into the different variables associated with winning film awards. In [a previous post]("https://carsonp4.github.io/2023/11/16/movie-scrape.html"), I scraped IMDb data to make a dataset containing every film nominated for a major film award in the 21st century. In this blog post, I am going to answer some film questions by doing some exploratory data analysis in Python.

[Here is a link to the repository containing all of the code and data from this analysis.](https://github.com/carsonp4/Final-Project/tree/main)

Here are the packages used in this post as well as loading in the data that can be found in the repository above:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
import networkx as nx
from itertools import combinations
import holoviews as hv
from holoviews import opts, dim
import holoviews.plotting.bokeh

df = pd.read_csv("maindf.csv", index_col=0)
```

## What Oscar Nominations Are The Most Correlated?

For this first question, I want to see which categories of Oscar nominations are the most correlated with one another. People have often said that being nominated for Best Director and Best Editing are correlated or that animated films are never nominated for Best Picture. So let's check that out! Here is the commented code I used to make a correlation plot:

```
# Create a dataframe that seperates out only the Oscar nomination columns
oscar_noms = df.loc[:, df.columns[df.columns.str.contains('Oscar') & df.columns.str.contains('nominated')]]

# Renaming the columns
oscar_noms.columns = oscar_noms.columns.map(lambda x: x.split("'")[3] if isinstance(x, str) and 'Oscar' in x and '_nominated' in x else x)

# Combining International and non-english because they are the same award just renamed
oscar_noms['International'] = oscar_noms['International'] + oscar_noms['Non_English']
oscar_noms.drop(columns=["Non_English"], inplace=True)

# Calculate total correlation for each category
total_correlation = oscar_noms.corr().sum(axis=1)

# Sort columns based on total correlation
sorted_columns = total_correlation.sort_values(ascending=False).index
oscar_noms_sorted = oscar_noms[sorted_columns]

# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = oscar_noms_sorted.corr()

# Create a heatmap using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 12))
heatmap = sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='RdYlBu', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5, center=0)
heatmap.set_xticklabels(heatmap.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, horizontalalignment='right')
plt.title('Correlation Of Films By Oscar Nomination (Sorted by Total Correlation)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Oscar Nomination Categories')
plt.ylabel('Oscar Nomination Categories')
plt.show()
```

And here is the correlation plot! Looks like what I said before was true! Also interesting to see that visual effects and sound are fairly correlated as well as costume design and art direction.

## How Do The Big Three Movie Ratings Compare?

In the dataset I created, there is data for each film on their ratings. There is a score out of 10 for IMDB, a score out of 100 for Metascore, and a score out of 100 (%) for rotten tomatoes. I wondered how these scores compared and what would a 3D plot look like with these variables. So here is the code I used!


```
# Creating data frame of just the ratings data
ratings = df[["IMDB", "Rotten_Tomatoes", "Metascore"]].dropna()

# Create a 3D scatter plot with labels as axis names
fig = go.Figure()

# Add The Data to the plot
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter3d(
    x=ratings['Rotten_Tomatoes'],
    y=ratings['Metascore'],
    z=ratings['IMDB'],
    text=[f'Rotten Tomatoes: {rt}<br>Metascore: {ms}<br>IMDB: {imdb}' 
          for rt, ms, imdb in zip(ratings['Rotten_Tomatoes'], ratings['Metascore'], ratings['IMDB'])],
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(
        size=8,
        color=ratings['IMDB'],
        colorscale='Viridis',
        opacity=0.8
    ),
    hovertemplate='%{text}'  # Set custom hover template
))

# Update layout for better aspect ratio
fig.update_layout(scene=dict(
    aspectratio=dict(x=61/89, y=0.3),
    aspectmode='manual'
))

# Add labels to the axes
fig.update_layout(scene=dict(xaxis=dict(title='Rotten Tomatoes'),
                             yaxis=dict(title='Metascore'),
                             zaxis=dict(title='IMDB')))

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

And here is the interactive plot.

## How does a film's advisory rating affect the box office and rating?

I have heard many times when a film receives an R rating instead of PG-13 that they are going to lose a lot of money at the box office. Is that really true? Well lets make a plot to check it out! For fun, let's also include the IMDB rating to see if that gives any insights.

```
# Get the data we want
advise = df.filter(regex='^Rating_|^IMDB$|^Boxoffice$').dropna()
advise.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename rating columns
advise.columns = advise.columns.str.replace('Rating_', '')

# Select only the common US ratings
advise = advise[["Title", "IMDB", "Boxoffice", "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17"]]

# Melt the DataFrame to long format for seaborn
advise_melt = pd.melt(advise, id_vars=['Title', 'IMDB', 'Boxoffice'], var_name='Rating', value_name='Value')

# Filter out rows where the value is 0 after melting
advise_melt = advise_melt[advise_melt['Value'] == 1]

# Create an interactive scatter plot with plotly
fig = px.scatter(
    advise_melt,
    x='Boxoffice',
    y='IMDB',
    color='Rating',
    hover_data=['Title', 'Rating', 'IMDB', 'Boxoffice'],
    title='Scatter Plot of IMDB vs Boxoffice with Movie Ratings',
    labels={'Boxoffice': 'Boxoffice', 'IMDB': 'IMDB'},
)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

And here is the interactive plot.

## Which Director's Films are the most successful?

Another thing that brings a lot of awards to a film can be a highly acclaimed director. So what director this century has had their films recognized the most? Let's check it out:

```
# Filter columns with 'Director_' prefix
director_columns = df.filter(like='Director_')

# Create a new DataFrame with the director names
directors_df = pd.DataFrame({'Director': director_columns.columns})

# Initialize columns for the count of nominations and winners
directors_df['Nominated'] = 0
directors_df['Winner'] = 0

# Iterate over each row in the original DataFrame
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    # Iterate over each director column
    for director_col in director_columns.columns:
        # Check if the director worked on the movie
        if row[director_col] == 1:
            # Check if the movie was nominated
            nominated_columns = [col for col in row.index if 'nominated' in col.lower()]
            for nominated_col in nominated_columns:
                if row[nominated_col] == 1:
                    directors_df.loc[directors_df['Director'] == director_col, 'Nominated'] += 1
            
            # Check if the movie was a winner
            winner_columns = [col for col in row.index if 'winner' in col.lower()]
            for winner_col in winner_columns:
                if row[winner_col] == 1:
                    directors_df.loc[directors_df['Director'] == director_col, 'Winner'] += 1

# Remove Director_ prefix
directors_df['Director'] = directors_df['Director'].str.replace('Director_', '')

# Making a variable to combine noms and wins 
directors_df["Significance"] = directors_df["Nominated"] + directors_df["Winner"] * 5

# Selecting the best 20 directors
director_plot_df = directors_df.sort_values(by='Significance', ascending=False).head(20)
director_plot_df = director_plot_df.sort_values(by='Winner', ascending=False)

# Creating a plot
fig = px.bar(director_plot_df, 
             x='Director', 
             y=['Nominated', 'Winner'], 
             barmode='group',
             labels={'value': 'Count', 'variable': ''},
             title='Film Award Nominations and Wins by Director From The 21st Century')

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

And here is the interactive plot.

## When In The Year Do Films Find The Most Success At The Box Office?

At the end of the day, the film industry is an industry. Many choices, whether artistic or marketing, have the bottom line in mind. So when in the year do film release dates have the best success at the box office? Let's check it out!

```
# Seleting the data we are interested in
rd = df[["Boxoffice", "Release_DOY"]].dropna()

# Creating a plot
fig = px.bar(rd, x='Release_DOY', y='Boxoffice', title='Release Day of Year Compared To Boxoffice')
fig.show()
```

Keep in mind, that there is a lot of bias in these results because companies probably would want to release their best movies at times like the summer, thanksgiving, and Christmas.

## Who Works With The Most People

Before I begin, I have always wanted to make a network graph so this was my excuse to do so. What I wanted to do was visualize which people this century have worked with the most people. This includes directors and writers for the films in the dataset. I removed any film that only had one person working on it and anyone that only has worked on one film just for better visibility.

```
# Create the Dataset with wanted variables
ng = df.filter(regex='^Writer_|^Director_')

# Clean up column names
ng.columns = ng.columns.str.replace('Writer_|Director_', '')

# COombine columns for people that have directed and written before
ng = ng.groupby(axis=1, level=0).sum().clip(upper=1)

# Remove films with one writer/director
ng = ng[ng.sum(axis=1) > 1]

# Remove writers/directors who only worked on one film
ng = ng.loc[:, ng.sum() > 1]

# Drop unknown
ng = ng.drop(columns=['Unknown'])

# Create an empty list to store pairs
pairs_list = []

# Iterate over rows in the original DataFrame
for index, row in ng.iterrows():
    # Find the names of people who worked on the current movie
    working_people = row.index[row == 1].tolist()

    # Generate pairs of people who worked together using combinations
    pairs = list(combinations(working_people, 2))

    # Add pairs to the list
    pairs_list.extend(pairs)

# Create a new DataFrame with the pairs
ng = pd.DataFrame(pairs_list, columns=['Person1', 'Person2'])

# Create the from and to lists
from_list = ng["Person1"].tolist()
to_list = ng["Person2"].tolist()

# Create nodes
node_list = from_list + to_list
node_list = list(set(node_list))

# Create graph and add nodes
G = nx.Graph()
for i in range(len(node_list)):
    G.add_node(node_list[i])
    G.add_edges_from([(from_list[i], to_list[i])])

# Find node positions
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.5, iterations=100)
for n, p in pos.items():
    G.nodes[n]['pos'] = p

# Make graph edges
edge_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=[],
    y=[],
    line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
    hoverinfo='none',
    mode='lines')
for edge in G.edges():
    x0, y0 = G.nodes[edge[0]]['pos']
    x1, y1 = G.nodes[edge[1]]['pos']
    edge_trace['x'] += tuple([x0, x1, None])
    edge_trace['y'] += tuple([y0, y1, None])

# Embed nodes
node_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=[],
    y=[],
    text=[],
    mode='markers',
    hoverinfo='text',
    marker=dict(
        showscale=True,
        colorscale='ice',
        reversescale=True,
        color=[],
        size=5,
        colorbar=dict(
            thickness=1,
            title='Node Connections',
            xanchor='left',
            titleside='right'
        ),
        line=dict(width=0)))
for node in G.nodes():
    x, y = G.nodes[node]['pos']
    node_trace['x'] += tuple([x])
    node_trace['y'] += tuple([y])
for node, adjacencies in enumerate(G.adjacency()):
    node_trace['marker']['color'] += tuple([len(adjacencies[1])])
    node_info = adjacencies[0]
    node_trace['text'] += tuple([node_info])

# Generate plot
title = "Network Graph Demonstration"
fig = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace, node_trace],
                layout=go.Layout(
                title=title,
                titlefont=dict(size=16),
                showlegend=False,
                hovermode='closest',
                margin=dict(b=21, l=5, r=5, t=40),
                xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False,
                           showticklabels=False, mirror=True),
                yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False, mirror=True)))
fig.show()

```
