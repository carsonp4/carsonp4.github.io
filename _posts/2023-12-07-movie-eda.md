I have always been a huge fan of film awards season and wanted to look into the different variables associated with winning film awards. In [a previous post]("https://carsonp4.github.io/2023/11/16/movie-scrape.html"), I scraped IMDb data to make a dataset containing every film nominated for a major film award in the 21st century. In this blog post, I am going to answer some film questions by doing some exploratory data analysis in python.
