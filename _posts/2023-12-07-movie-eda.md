I have always been a huge fan of film awards season and wanted to look into the different variables associated with winning film awards. In [a previous post]("https://carsonp4.github.io/2023/11/16/movie-scrape.html"), I scraped IMDb data to make a dataset containing every film nominated for a major film award in the 21st century. In this blog post, I am going to answer some film questions by doing some exploratory data analysis in Python.

[Here is a link to the repository containing all of the code and data from this analysis.](https://github.com/carsonp4/Final-Project/tree/main)

Here are the packages used in this post as well as loading in the data that can be found in the repository above:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
import networkx as nx
from itertools import combinations
import holoviews as hv
from holoviews import opts, dim
import holoviews.plotting.bokeh

df = pd.read_csv("maindf.csv", index_col=0)
```

## What Oscar Nominations Are The Most Correlated?

For this first question, I want to see which categories of Oscar nominations are the most correlated with one another. People have often said that being nominated for Best Director and Best Editing are correlated or that animated films are never nominated for Best Picture. So let's check that out! Here is the commented code I used to make a correlation plot:

```
# Create a dataframe that seperates out only the Oscar nomination columns
oscar_noms = df.loc[:, df.columns[df.columns.str.contains('Oscar') & df.columns.str.contains('nominated')]]

# Renaming the columns
oscar_noms.columns = oscar_noms.columns.map(lambda x: x.split("'")[3] if isinstance(x, str) and 'Oscar' in x and '_nominated' in x else x)

# Combining International and non-english because they are the same award just renamed
oscar_noms['International'] = oscar_noms['International'] + oscar_noms['Non_English']
oscar_noms.drop(columns=["Non_English"], inplace=True)

# Calculate total correlation for each category
total_correlation = oscar_noms.corr().sum(axis=1)

# Sort columns based on total correlation
sorted_columns = total_correlation.sort_values(ascending=False).index
oscar_noms_sorted = oscar_noms[sorted_columns]

# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = oscar_noms_sorted.corr()

# Create a heatmap using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 12))
heatmap = sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='RdYlBu', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5, center=0)
heatmap.set_xticklabels(heatmap.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, horizontalalignment='right')
plt.title('Correlation Of Films By Oscar Nomination (Sorted by Total Correlation)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Oscar Nomination Categories')
plt.ylabel('Oscar Nomination Categories')
plt.show()
```

And here is the correlation plot! Looks like what I said before was true! Also interesting to see that visual effects and sound are fairly correlated as well as costume design and art direction.

## How Do The Big Three Movie Ratings Compare?

In the dataset I created, there is data for each film on their ratings. There is a score out of 10 for IMDB, a score out of 100 for Metascore, and a score out of 100 (%) for rotten tomatoes. I wondered how these scores compared and what would a 3D plot look like with these variables. So here is the code I used!


```
# Creating data frame of just the ratings data
ratings = df[["IMDB", "Rotten_Tomatoes", "Metascore"]].dropna()

# Create a 3D scatter plot with labels as axis names
fig = go.Figure()

# Add The Data to the plot
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter3d(
    x=ratings['Rotten_Tomatoes'],
    y=ratings['Metascore'],
    z=ratings['IMDB'],
    text=[f'Rotten Tomatoes: {rt}<br>Metascore: {ms}<br>IMDB: {imdb}' 
          for rt, ms, imdb in zip(ratings['Rotten_Tomatoes'], ratings['Metascore'], ratings['IMDB'])],
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(
        size=8,
        color=ratings['IMDB'],
        colorscale='Viridis',
        opacity=0.8
    ),
    hovertemplate='%{text}'  # Set custom hover template
))

# Update layout for better aspect ratio
fig.update_layout(scene=dict(
    aspectratio=dict(x=61/89, y=0.3),
    aspectmode='manual'
))

# Add labels to the axes
fig.update_layout(scene=dict(xaxis=dict(title='Rotten Tomatoes'),
                             yaxis=dict(title='Metascore'),
                             zaxis=dict(title='IMDB')))

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

And here is the interactive plot.

## How does a film's advisory rating affect the box office and rating?

I have heard many times when a film receives an R rating instead of PG-13 that they are going to lose a lot of money at the box office. Is that really true? Well lets make a plot to check it out! For fun, let's also include the IMDB rating to see if that gives any insights.

```
# Get the data we want
advise = df.filter(regex='^Rating_|^IMDB$|^Boxoffice$').dropna()
advise.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename rating columns
advise.columns = advise.columns.str.replace('Rating_', '')

# Select only the common US ratings
advise = advise[["Title", "IMDB", "Boxoffice", "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17"]]

# Melt the DataFrame to long format for seaborn
advise_melt = pd.melt(advise, id_vars=['Title', 'IMDB', 'Boxoffice'], var_name='Rating', value_name='Value')

# Filter out rows where the value is 0 after melting
advise_melt = advise_melt[advise_melt['Value'] == 1]

# Create an interactive scatter plot with plotly
fig = px.scatter(
    advise_melt,
    x='Boxoffice',
    y='IMDB',
    color='Rating',
    hover_data=['Title', 'Rating', 'IMDB', 'Boxoffice'],
    title='Scatter Plot of IMDB vs Boxoffice with Movie Ratings',
    labels={'Boxoffice': 'Boxoffice', 'IMDB': 'IMDB'},
)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

And here is the interactive plot.
